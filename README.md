# Follow the Plot

This is an attempt at a month-long project in October 2018 where I
will generate svg files to plot/cut on
my [Cricut](https://home.cricut.com/) cutting machine. My plan is to
develop some generative tools and processes to do it.

## Projects

### [1 (2018-10-01)](1)

Write a Pony program that draws a big circle and then some smaller
circles that follow a sine curve. Since Pony doesn't have an SVG
library I'm hand-rolling my own SVG. Maybe I'll end up with a library
at the end of this.

### [2 (2018-10-02)](2)

I decided to try to write a little drawing language. Inspired by
Postscript I went ahead and did something stack-based. It is ugly, but
it has a conditional branch so ... you can probably do some terrible
amazing things with it. Today's piece is a straight line with some zig
zag lines.
